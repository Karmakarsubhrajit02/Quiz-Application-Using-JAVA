# Quiz-Application-Using-JAVA
### Project Description:
The *Online Quiz Application* is a Java Swing-based desktop application that allows users to take quizzes on various subjects. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can answer questions, submit their answers, and view their scores. This project can be used in educational institutes or for personal assessment purposes. It supports multiple-choice questions and allows easy navigation between questions.

### Tech Stack:
- *Front-end*: Java Swing (for creating the graphical user interface)
- *Back-end*: Java for handling business logic
- *Database*: SQLite (for storing quiz questions, user information, and scores)
- *Tools*: 
  - Java Development Kit (JDK)
  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for code development
  - SQLite Browser (optional, for managing the database)

### Architecture:
The architecture follows the *MVC (Model-View-Controller)* pattern to separate business logic, UI, and data. 

- *Model*: Contains classes that represent the core data structures like Question, Quiz, and User. It handles the logic of retrieving and saving data to the database.
  
- *View: Built using Java Swing, the view includes different screens like the **Login Screen, **Quiz Screen, and **Result Screen*. Each screen has components (buttons, labels, text fields, etc.) and event listeners that connect user actions with the controller.

- *Controller*: Manages the flow of the application. It receives input from the view (e.g., button clicks), processes data (e.g., calculates scores), and updates the view accordingly.

### Functional Components:
1. *Login and Registration*: User authentication, allowing users to register and log in with credentials.
2. *Quiz Interface*: Displays quiz questions, tracks progress, and lets users navigate between questions.
3. *Scoring System*: Automatically calculates and displays scores based on answers submitted.
4. *Admin Panel (optional)*: Allows administrators to add, edit, or delete questions and manage quizzes.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to build a desktop-based quiz application using Java Swing and MVC architecture. It showcases the integration of GUI, database, and logic layers in Java. This application can serve as a foundation for more complex quiz systems with additional features, such as question randomization, time limits, and analytics. The project improves Java Swing and database management skills and can be extended to a web-based or mobile application for a broader user base.
